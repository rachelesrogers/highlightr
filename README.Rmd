This package can be used to create a highlighted source document based on the frequency of phrases found in single or multiple note sheets.
The goal of this method is to indicate the portions of the source document that individuals felt was most worth copying into notes, based on phrase frequency.
The inputs necessary for this procedure are a notes document and a source document.
The output will be HTML code for generating the highlighted text.

## Installation

You can install from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("highlightr")
```

You can install the development version of highlightr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rachelesrogers/highlightr")
```


## Example

```{r, message=FALSE}
# load library
library(highlightr)

# rename desired column of derivative documents to 'page_notes'
comment_example_rename <- dplyr::rename(comment_example, page_notes=Notes)

# tokenize derivative documents
toks_comment <- token_comments(comment_example_rename)

# rename desired column of source document to 'text'
transcript_example_rename <- dplyr::rename(transcript_example, text=Text)

# tokenize source document
toks_transcript <- token_transcript(transcript_example_rename)

# use fuzzy matching in collocation
collocation_object <- collocate_comments_fuzzy(toks_transcript, toks_comment)

# connect collocation frequencies to source document
merged_frequency <- transcript_frequency(transcript_example_rename, collocation_object)

# create `ggplot` object of the transcript
freq_plot <- collocation_plot(merged_frequency)

# add html tags to source document
page_highlight <- highlighted_text(freq_plot)

```

```{r results='asis', eval=FALSE}
page_highlight
```
`page_highlight` will produce HTML output that can then be rendered into highlighted text.
This can be done in R Markdown by specifying the object outside of a code chunk as `` `r '\x60r page_highlight\x60'` ``, and knitting the document to HTML.

Alternatively, the `xml2` package can be used to save the output as an html file, as shown in the following code:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

# load `xml2` library

library(xml2)

# save html output to desired location

xml2::write_html(xml2::read_html(page_highlight), "filename.html")

```

The below image is generated through the resulting html output (as seen in the `vignette("highlightr")`).
